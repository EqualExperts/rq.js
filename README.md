Allow a mongo user to 'tag' and 'save' commonly-used queries, so they can be recalled and run at will, even across sessions

Download rq.js.zip and extract it to a location of your choice. In your mongo client, (at the shell), load rq.js using something like the following:

Krishnans-MacBook-Pro:rq.js km$ mongo  
MongoDB shell version: 2.2.1  
connecting to: test  
\> load('rq.js')
